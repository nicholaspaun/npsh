* Build the shell with make.
* run.h contains some defines you can use to change the shell's behaviour.
	TC 	- enables TTY control (default)
	DELAY	- enables artifical delays (default)
* The shell is organized into separate modules
	npsh	 - Main REPL (incl. parser)
	run	 - Manages child processes, from fork to exec to wait
	jobs	 - Maintains the internal structures used to track jobs
	builtin	 - Implementations of shell builtins
		BUILTIN_INLINE		- Run in the shell's main process
		BUILTIN_FORK		- Run in a child process
* Ctrl+\ still hasn't been touched by the signal handlers specified in the assignment, 
  if you just want to quit.
